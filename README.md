#### This is the frontend repository for Montaño Culinary School, a pedagogic project for our studies of full-stack website development at Peñascal Cooperative. The project was developed using Vue.js and Bootstrap for the user interface, and the initial prototyping was done using Figma.

Application Sections:
The frontend of the project includes the following main sections:

- Home

- Daily Menu: In this section, users can view the updated daily menu.

- Star Menu: In this section, users can view the updated star menu.

- Contact

- Various sections of prepared products are displayed, including meat, pastries, skewers, and portions. Users can explore the different products offered by the establishment.

- Intranet : This section is designed for the staff of Montaño center, allowing them to consult, add, and delete products.

Points for Future Improvements:
While the application is functional in its current state, some points have been identified for future improvements:

Complete Access to the Intranet through Login: Although the code has been prepared in both the backend and frontend to enable access to the intranet through a login system, some connection errors persist from the frontend at the time of delivery.

New Product Section: There are plans to add a new section on the homepage (Home) dedicated to showcasing product news. This section will be updated weekly, allowing customers to see the latest additions to the catalog and special promotions.
